arduino-arpeggiator
===================

Arpeggiator based on Arduino and the SparkFun midi shield. 
It works, but the buttons are a bit flaky. I need to figure that out.
Next up will probably be midi synch. I might replace hold-mode on/off
with an octave button, since I will probably always use it in hold mode.


Button D2 = Toggle hold-mode on/off

Button D3 = Cycle through arpeggio modes (up, down, up-down, one-three)

Button D4 = Stop arpeggio


Pot A1 = Tempo

Pot A2 = Velocity
