arduino-arpeggiator
===================

Arpeggiator based on Arduino and the SparkFun midi shield. 
It works, but the button interaction is a bit flaky. I need to figure that out.


Button D2 = Toggle hold-mode on/off

Button D3 = Arp mode (currently up or down)

Button D4 = Stop arpeggio


Pot A1 = Tempo

Pot A2 = Velocity
